# SecureCode Scanner

## Introduction
SecureCode Scanner is a static code analysis tool designed to detect security vulnerabilities in Python source code. It scans code for specific patterns that may indicate common security flaws. This tool is useful for identifying issues like hardcoded passwords, unsafe code execution, insecure deserialization, and more. The tool supports scanning both individual files and entire directories, and it generates a comprehensive JSON report of vulnerabilities.

## Features
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including:
  - Hardcoded passwords
  - Insecure deserialization
  - SQL injection risks
  - Command injection
  - Weak hashing algorithms
  - Insecure input handling
  - Dangerous imports and system calls
  - And more...
- **CLI Banner:** Displays an introductory message when the tool is run.
- **Directory Scanning:** Recursively scans directories for Python files and analyzes them for vulnerabilities.
- **Report Generation:** Outputs a detailed JSON report of the vulnerabilities found in the scanned code.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or later
- **Dependencies:** `re`, `os`, `json` (all standard libraries)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securecode-scanner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd securecode-scanner
   ```

3. The tool uses Pythonâ€™s standard libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

### Run the Tool
To run the tool, execute the following command:

```bash
python tool.py
```

The tool will prompt you for a directory to scan.

### Example Run
```bash
Enter the target directory to scan: /path/to/your/code
Starting secure code scan...
Scanning: /path/to/your/code/example.py
Scanning: /path/to/your/code/subdirectory/example2.py
...
Results saved to secure_code_scan_results.json
Scan completed! Check secure_code_scan_results.json for details.
```

The results will be saved in the `secure_code_scan_results.json` file.

## How It Works
1. **Banner Display:** When the tool starts, the `display_banner` function shows an introductory message.
2. **Pattern Matching:** The tool searches for the following vulnerabilities based on regex patterns:
   - **Hardcoded Passwords:** Detects passwords, API keys, or tokens stored directly in the code.
   - **Insecure Deserialization:** Flags unsafe usage of `pickle.loads()`.
   - **SQL Injection:** Identifies patterns that could lead to SQL injection attacks.
   - **Command Injection:** Flags unsafe system calls made with `os.system()` or `subprocess` functions.
   - **Weak Hashing Algorithms:** Flags the use of weak hashing functions like MD5 or SHA1.
   - **Insecure Input Handling:** Detects the use of `input()` without proper sanitization.
   - **Insecure Randomness:** Flags insecure random functions like `random.choice()` or `random.randint()`.
   - **HTTP URLs:** Flags hardcoded HTTP URLs (which should be HTTPS).
   - **Open Redirects:** Flags potential open redirects in web applications.
   - **Sensitive Logging:** Detects logging of sensitive information like passwords or tokens.
   - **Overly Permissive Permissions:** Flags file permission settings that may expose sensitive files.
3. **Scanning Files and Directories:** The tool scans files in the specified directory (and subdirectories) for these patterns. Python files (`.py`) are the default, but you can easily adjust it to scan other file types.
4. **Reporting:** When vulnerabilities are found, the tool generates a JSON file that lists:
   - The file path
   - The line number where the vulnerability is found
   - The content of the vulnerable line

### Vulnerability Patterns
The tool detects the following vulnerabilities based on predefined patterns:

- **Hardcoded Passwords:**
  ```regex
  r"['"](password|passwd|pwd)['"]\s*:\s*['"].+['"]"
  ```

- **Insecure Deserialization:**
  ```regex
  r"pickle\.loads\("
  ```

- **SQL Injection:**
  ```regex
  r"(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE)\s+.*FROM.*['"].*['"]"
  ```

- **Command Injection:**
  ```regex
  r"os\.system\(|subprocess\.(call|run|Popen)\("
  ```

- **Weak Hashing:**
  ```regex
  r"hashlib\.(md5|sha1)\("
  ```

- **Insecure Input:**
  ```regex
  r"(?<!#).*input\("
  ```

- **Insecure Randomness:**
  ```regex
  r"random\.(randint|random|choice)\("
  ```

- **HTTP URLs:**
  ```regex
  r"http://[^\s]+"
  ```

- **Open Redirects:**
  ```regex
  r"redirect\((.*request.args.*)\)"
  ```

- **Hardcoded API Keys:**
  ```regex
  r"(apikey|api_key|token|access_token)\s*=\s*['"].+['"]"
  ```

- **Overly Permissive Permissions:**
  ```regex
  r"os\.chmod\(.+, 0o7[0-7][0-7]\)"
  ```

- **Sensitive Logging:**
  ```regex
  r"logging\.(debug|info|warn|error)\(.*(password|secret|token)"
  ```

## Code Breakdown

### `display_banner()`
Displays a welcome banner when the tool is run.

### `scan_file(file_path)`
Scans an individual file for vulnerabilities:
- Reads the file line by line
- Applies regex patterns to detect security vulnerabilities
- Returns a list of found vulnerabilities, including the name, line number, and content.

### `scan_directory(directory_path)`
Recursively scans the directory for Python files and calls `scan_file` for each one. Vulnerabilities are stored in a dictionary with file paths as keys and vulnerability details as values.

### `save_results(results, filename)`
Saves the results to a JSON file for easy review. The file is formatted with indentation for better readability.

### Main Execution
In the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block:
- The banner is displayed.
- The user is prompted to input a directory to scan.
- The scan starts, and results are saved in a JSON file.
